Kaeng Hu is a cultural region situated at the eastern edge of Dai Liuwk, the world's biggest continent. It roughly coincides with the Sinosphere in our reality with nations at its edge also a part of other cultural regions with not really a fixed border in between one or another. 

Kaewng Hu is arguably one of the most influential regions if not the most influential when it came to creating the interconnected modern world. But on the eve of a interdimensional invasion, Kaewng Hu is a region divided amongst corrupt officials, brutal warlords, and ambitious states looking to unite the region once again under an empire but with themselves at the head.
