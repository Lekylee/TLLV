# Basic
Combat in [[Game Name]] is in rather simple

Whichever party that has Initiative moves first. Each member of the attacking party makes an Attack move.

Whenever a character is attacked, they may make a Defense move. After every attacker has made a move, characters that have not yet moved may make a retaliatory attack (Attack move, but they cannot be responded to with a Defense move).

Provided the Defending party is not incapacitated, a new round starts, repeat with the formerly Defending party now Attacking.
