Unlike most other TTRPGs, [[Game Name]] only has three stats. When it comes to skills there is no limit on the page. If you can think of a topic for your character to be good at and if it's reasonable to the setting, that's a skill. Whether stats or skills, all can be increased via training and usually separately.
## Spirituality 
SPI is the most important stat that is the closest analogy to levels in other games. It represents a character's connection to the [[Spirit World Equivalent]], usually indicating how much magic a character has access to. 

Techniques you have access to is dependent on this stat.
## Physicality 
PHY represents a character's overall physical stats: strength, endurance, speed, health, etc

Weapons also have a PHY stat to represent damage. 
## Dexterity 
DEX represents a character's how coordinated a character is. Accuracy with range weapons, dodging attacks, parrying, disarming, taking cover, etc all fall under DEX
# Skills
There are as many skills on [[Sammoi]] as there are in your reality (if not more counting magic). Starting skills are provided by your [[Cultural Background]], [[Traits]], [[Social Class]], and [[Combat Archetype]].
